# Comparative Analysis of Naive and KMP Algorithms

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the **Naive** and **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** string-matching algorithms, developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms lab.

## Overview

String matching is a fundamental problem in computer science, with applications across fields such as text processing, data retrieval, and bioinformatics. In this project, we implement both the Naive and KMP algorithms to analyze their performance on various datasets and patterns of different lengths. We focus on metrics such as time complexity and efficiency in different cases.

## Contents

- **Source Code**: Implementations of the Naive and KMP algorithms in Python
- **Dataset**: A range of test cases with varying text and pattern lengths for performance evaluation
- **Results**: Empirical results and analysis comparing the two algorithms across multiple scenarios
